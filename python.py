# print("Hello World")


# Create a list of integers from 1 to 10. Use list slicing to print only the first 5 elements.
# new_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# print(new_list[0:5])

# Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a list of its elements squared.
# lst = [0,1,2,45,3,2,4,5,4]
# squared = (n**2 for n in lst)
# print(list(squared))
# print(squared)
# for n in squared:
#     print(n)
